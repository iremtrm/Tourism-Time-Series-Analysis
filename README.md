This project presents a comprehensive time series analysis of monthly tourist arrivals from Germany to Turkey between 2008 and 2020. The aim is to identify trend and seasonality patterns in the data and to make forecasts for future periods.

The analysis includes:

Visualization of the time series

ACF & PACF plots for autocorrelation structure

Seasonal and trend decomposition using additive and multiplicative models

Application of Centered Moving Averages (CMA)

Regression modeling with seasonal components

Winters smoothing methods (additive & multiplicative)

Box-Jenkins (ARIMA) modeling for time series forecasting

Final forecast evaluations and visual interpretation

All code used in the analysis is provided and documented. The project offers a practical example of time series modeling applied to real-world tourism data.
